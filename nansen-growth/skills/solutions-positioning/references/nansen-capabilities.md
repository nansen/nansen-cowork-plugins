## Differentiators

1. **Optimizely depth**: One of the most experienced Optimizely partners globally.
   Deep knowledge of the platform's architecture, not just surface-level implementation.

2. **AI practice with production experience**: Not just talking about AI - building
   and deploying real AI agents and tools. The Opal Agent Studio and Cowork plugin
   work is live, not theoretical.

3. **Senior-heavy team**: Clients work directly with experienced practitioners,
   not junior staff supervised remotely. This means faster time-to-value and fewer
   mistakes.

4. **Long-term partnership model**: High client retention. Nansen invests in
   understanding the client's business deeply, not just executing projects.

5. **Midwest value**: Competitive rates vs. coastal agencies without sacrificing
   quality. Important for clients watching budgets.

6. **Full-stack capability**: Strategy through execution. Clients don't need a
   separate strategy firm and implementation shop.
